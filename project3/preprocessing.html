  <!-- How I implemented SASS: I used a vscode extension called "Live Sass Compiler"
  to compile my .scss files into .css files. It features live compilation viewing which
  was very useful. I used SASS variables for custom colors that were used 
  more than once for easy adjustment. I also used nested styles for cleaner code. -->

  <p class="intro">Preprocessing can be implemented client-side, typically in a browser. It usually comes in a javascript file
    in order for the preprocessing to function. In terms of server side preprocessing, there is typically a package that needs
    to be installed on the server in order for files to be recognized and processed into CSS.
  </p>

    <h2>SASS Mechanisms</h2>
    <div class="card 1">
      <li>
        <h3>Mixins</h3>
        <p>Mixins allow for the definition of multiple styles that can be dropped in anywhere into a single style rule.
          They cannot include top-level statements.
        </p>
      </li>
    </div>

    <div class="card 2">
      <li>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>SASS variables are assigned a name beginning with $, which can then be refered to anywhere a value would normally
          appear.
        </p>
      </li>
    </div>
          
    <div class="card 3">
      <li>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions are used to define operations using SassScript values. They can be reused throughout the stylesheet
          and provide a large degree of readability.
        </p>
      </li>
    </div>

    <div class="card 4">
      <li>
        <h3>Operators</h3>
        <p>In addition to standard mathematical ones like + and *, Sass supports additonal operators such as == and !=, to
          check if values are identical, +, -, and / for concatenating strings, and others.
        </p>
      </li>
    </div>

    <div class="card 5">
      <li>
        <h3>Nested Variables</h3>
        <p>Nested variables allow for precisely what the title describes, which can be implemented to a great degree of
          usefulness in order to write more concise and readable code.
        </p>
