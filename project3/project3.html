  <p class="intro">Responsive design is an important element of any project, as it ensures that the content that is being displayed on your site is digestable and
    pleasing to the eye, regardless of the device that the user is viewing it on. It can have a big impact on the target audience
    by accounting for who may be accessing your site and where they may be accessing it from, so that user experience does not suffer.
