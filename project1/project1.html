        <h2>Describe how search engines work:</h2>
        <p>Search engines use web crawlers, also known as spiders, to find web pages. These pages are then added to an index, which is a like a large bank of sites that the engine can pull from
          to display sites to the user of the engine. The engine uses various factors, such as keywords, age, and page optimization (or speed), to build an algorithm that displays the most
          relevant results to the user's search.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags:</h2>
        <p>Keywords are an important part of any webpage due to how they help deliver relevant content to those browsing the web. Including relevant keywords increases the likelihood that your
          site will be delivered to your target audience. According to Google, it is important to consider what a user might search for to find your content, and plan your keywords accordingly.
        </p>
        <h2>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Ranking for relevant search terms, ideally earning links from established pages ranking for your phrases</li>
          <li>Oberserving and building upon competitor's backlinks</li>
          <li>Being linked to by a page with fewer links</li>
          <li>Utilizing Moz Domain Authority to calculate how likely your domain is to rank for a given query</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Additionally, backlinks can help crawlers, and page/image optimization can lead to a faster speed, which helps with SEO. Comprehensiveness of the page's content can be a boon to
          relevant content links, and is also an all-around good practice when building web pages.
        </p>
        <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy?</h2>
        <p>A good heading hierarchy begins first with only utilizing a single h1 tag. This is to be used for the document title, with further heading tags becoming smaller as the page goes on.
          h2 tags are used most commonly as subheadings, with h4-h6 tags used only to provide legibility and structure within sections of the page. When used properly, heading tags can be an
          invaluable aid to SEO and legibility of your site.
