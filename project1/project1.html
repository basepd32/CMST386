        <h2>Describe how search engines work:</h2>
        <p>Search engines use web crawlers, also known as spiders, to find web pages. These pages are then added to an index, which is a like a large bank of sites that the engine can pull from
          to display sites to the user of the engine. The engine uses various factors, such as keywords, age, and page optimization (or speed), to build an algorithm that displays the most
          relevant results to the user's search.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags:</h2>
        <p>Meta tags are bits of information that are passed to search engines, as well as viewers of your site, about the information that your site contains. They are important not only to
          provide this information, but also to affect how likely your site is to appear towards the top of the SERP (search engine result page).
        </p>
        <h2>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Page content</li>
          <li>Page title</li>
          <li>Meta description</li>
          <li>Meta keywords</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Additionally, backlinks can help crawlers, and page/image optimization can lead to a faster speed, which helps with SEO. Comprehensiveness of the page's content can be a boon to
          relevant content links, and is also an all-around good practice when building web pages.
        </p>
        <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy?</h2>
        <p>A good heading hierarchy begins first with only utilizing a single h1 tag. This is to be used for the document title, with further heading tags becoming smaller as the page goes on.
          h2 tags are used most commonly as subheadings, with h4-h6 tags used only to provide legibility and structure within sections of the page. When used properly, heading tags can be an
          invaluable aid to SEO and legibility of your site.
